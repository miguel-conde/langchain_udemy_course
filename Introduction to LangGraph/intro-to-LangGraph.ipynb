    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to LangChain Academy’s Introduction to LangGraph course! This course is divided into six modules, starting with the basics and gradually progressing to more advanced topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each module includes video lessons to walk you through key concepts, along with corresponding notebooks. You’ll also find a studio subdirectory in each module, featuring a set of relevant graphs that we’ll explore using the LangGraph API and Studio.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s our recommended setup to get started with the course. We'll be using the set of notebooks located [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-academy). If you prefer to download the notebooks manually, you can access a ZIP file [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-academy/archive/refs/heads/main.zip). Each module will also include links to the corresponding notebooks, with additional options to access them in Google Colab for a quick start.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python version\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the most out of this course, please ensure you're using Python 3.11. This version is required for best compatibility with LangGraph. If you're on an older version, upgrading will ensure everything runs smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "python3 --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clone repo\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-academy.git\n",
    "$ cd langchain-academy\n",

    "$ pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have Jupyter set up, follow installation instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install).\n",

    "\n",
    "Tavily Search API is a search engine optimized for LLMs and RAG, aimed at efficient, quick, and persistent search results. You can sign up for an API key [here](https://tavily.com/). It’s easy to sign up and offers a generous free tier. Some lessons in Module 4 will use Tavily.\n",

    "## Set up LangGraph Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, LangGraph Studio is only compatible with macOS. Additionally, if you plan to use the notebooks in Google Colab, skip the LangGraph Studio portions (they will not run).\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the latest .dmg file [here](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-studio?tab=readme-ov-file#download). Then, install Docker Desktop for Mac [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphs for LangGraph Studio are in the **module-x/studio/** folders. To use LangGraph Studio, you will need to create a .env file with the relevant API keys. Run this from the command line to create these files for Module 1 to 4. As an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ for i in {1..4}; do\n",
    "cp module-$i/studio/.env.example module-$i/studio/.env\n",
