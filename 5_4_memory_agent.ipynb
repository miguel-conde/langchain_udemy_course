    "## Review\n",
    "\n",
    "We created a chatbot that saves semantic memories to a single [user profile](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/#profile) or [collection](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/memory/#collection).\n",
    "\n",
    "We introduced [Trustcall](https://github.com/hinthornw/trustcall) as a way to update either schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we're going to pull together the pieces we've learned to build an [agent](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/agentic_concepts/) with long-term memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our agent, `task_mAIstro`, will help us manage a ToDo list!\n",
    "\n",
    "The chatbots we built previously always reflected on the conversation and saved memories.\n",
    "\n",
    "`task_mAIstro` will decide when to save memories (items to our ToDo list).\n",
    "\n",
    "The chatbots we built previously always saved one type of memory, a profile or a collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "`task_mAIstro` can decide to save to either a user profile or a collection of ToDo items.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition semantic memory, `task_mAIstro` also will manage procedural memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows the user to update their preferences for creating ToDo items."
